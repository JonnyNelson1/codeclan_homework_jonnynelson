```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)

project_management <- read_csv("data/project_management.csv")

head(project_management)
```

# Plotting the data 

```{r}
project_management %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = actual_length, y = estimated_length)) +
  geom_point()
```

# Obtaining the correlation co-efficient:

```{r}
project_management %>%
  summarise(cor = cor(estimated_length, actual_length))

# Correlation coefficient = 0.805 - this mean that estimated length is positively correlated with actual_length
```

# Model

```{r}
library(modelr)

new_model <- lm(estimated_length ~ actual_length, project_management)

summary(new_model)

# For every increase by 1 day in the the actual length, the estimated length increases by (0.52921*actual_length) - so maybe 1/2 a day
```

# Diagnostics

```{r}
library(ggfortify)

autoplot(new_model)

# Very strange Residual vs Fitted and Scale-Location
```
